These infos were reset on 17 April 2025 at approximately 21:30.
While attempting to start the debugger to fix a refactor issue, the EEPROM was accidentally erased.
The logging originally started approximately in April of 2024.
Fucking hell, I just realized I have been using this mouse I built for a whole year (stll working on it).
The last 12 months have been eventful, to say the least:
- graduated university
- moved to another city
- started my first full time job
- started investing
- re-started working out (calisthenics with a little running)
Having lost this data makes me feel like I lost a little bit of what happened.
I cannot help it but to sprinkle these kind of 'memory bookmarks' everywhere I go.
Every lost memory feels like a tragic event to me, that's how attached to life I am.
Now that all of these things have been said, I feel much better about the lost data.
